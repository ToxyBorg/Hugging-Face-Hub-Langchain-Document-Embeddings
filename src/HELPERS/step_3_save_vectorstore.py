"""
    This code defines a function called save_vectorstore that saves a FAISS index as a file at the specified directory path and file name. 

    It imports the os module and the FAISS class from the langchain.vectorstores.faiss module. 

    The function takes three arguments: 
        vectorstore which is the FAISS index to be saved, 
        directory_path which is the path to the directory where the file will be saved, and 
        file_name which is the name of the file to be saved. 
        
    The function:
        creates the directory if it doesn't exist, 
        creates the file path, and 
        saves the FAISS index to the file.
